# GitHub REST API Audit

## Scope

This audit compares `@packages/github-api` to the GitHub REST OpenAPI description at:

- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/refs/heads/main/descriptions-next/ghes-3.20/ghes-3.20.yaml`

The focus is not just "does a route exist", but which parts of the simulator are:

- stubbed from OpenAPI examples
- stateful or scriptable against the in-memory store
- extensible by consumers

## Executive Summary

`packages/github-api` has three distinct REST support layers:

1. The foundation simulator can auto-stub any operation present in the loaded OpenAPI document via `mockResponseForOperation(...)` when no explicit handler is registered.
2. `packages/github-api` adds a small set of built-in stateful handlers backed by `initialState` and selectors.
3. Consumers can extend the simulator with custom OpenAPI handlers, Express routes, and store extensions.

Against the GHES 3.20 REST spec, the important distinction is:

- Stubbed coverage can be broad if the GHES 3.20 schema is loaded.
- Built-in scriptable coverage is narrow: 13 explicit operation handlers.
- Out of the box, the package does not even load the GHES 3.20 spec. It defaults to the bundled dotcom schema `schema/api.github.com.json`.

## Key Findings

### 1. Default runtime coverage is not GHES 3.20

The package defaults `apiSchema` to `api.github.com.json`, not the GHES 3.20 YAML. That bundled schema is synced from the dotcom description, not the GHES document.

- `packages/github-api/src/index.ts` defaults `apiSchema` to `"api.github.com.json"`.
- `packages/github-api/sync.ts` fetches `descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json`.
- `packages/github-api/schema/README.md` also describes the REST schema as coming from `descriptions/api.github.com`.

Implication:

- The default simulator is aligned to the bundled dotcom schema, not the GHES 3.20 schema used for this audit.
- To get GHES 3.20-wide stub coverage, a caller must pass the GHES schema path into `simulation({ apiSchema })`.

### 2. GHES 3.20 is much broader than the built-in GitHub mock logic

From the GHES 3.20 YAML:

- 702 path entries
- 1348 operations

Largest tags by operation count:

| Tag                | Operations |
| ------------------ | ---------: |
| `repos`            |        196 |
| `actions`          |        160 |
| `enterprise-admin` |        151 |
| `orgs`             |         87 |
| `issues`           |         45 |
| `apps`             |         38 |
| `users`            |         37 |
| `teams`            |         35 |
| `activity`         |         32 |
| `dependabot`       |         28 |
| `packages`         |         27 |
| `pulls`            |         27 |
| `projects`         |         26 |
| `secret-scanning`  |         22 |
| `code-security`    |         20 |
| `gists`            |         20 |
| `git`              |         13 |

The built-in GitHub mock contributes 13 explicit REST handlers, or about `0.96%` of the GHES 3.20 operation surface.

### 3. Stubbed coverage and scriptable coverage are very different

The foundation layer registers a `notImplemented` handler that returns `c.api.mockResponseForOperation(...)`. That means:

- any operation present in the loaded schema can return some example-based response
- but only explicitly registered handlers are stateful or behaviorally scriptable

In practice:

- GHES 3.20 schema loaded: potentially broad stubbed coverage
- default dotcom schema loaded: broad stubbed coverage for that smaller, different schema
- built-in scriptable coverage: still only the explicit operation handlers below

### 4. `initialState` is the switch that turns on built-in GitHub behavior

`packages/github-api/src/rest/index.ts` returns `{}` immediately when `initialState` is absent.

Implication:

- without `initialState`, none of the built-in GitHub REST handlers register
- without `initialState`, `extend.openapiHandlers` also gets suppressed because it is merged inside that same guarded return
- in that mode, REST behavior is effectively pure OpenAPI example stubbing plus the non-OpenAPI Express routes

This is a meaningful gotcha for consumers who expect custom REST handlers to work without seeding store state.

## Built-In Scriptable REST Coverage

The explicit OpenAPI handler map lives in `packages/github-api/src/rest/index.ts`.

## What Is Stubbed But Not Really Mocked

If the relevant OpenAPI schema is loaded, the simulator can still return example payloads for many operations with no custom logic behind them. That is useful for shallow client integration, but it is not equivalent to a mock with controllable state.

These areas are effectively stub-only by default relative to GHES 3.20:

- `actions`
- `enterprise-admin`
- `issues`
- `teams`
- `activity`
- `dependabot`
- `packages`
- `pulls`
- `projects`
- `secret-scanning`
- `code-security`
- `gists`
- `checks`
- `migrations`
- enterprise and admin paths such as `/enterprises/*`, `/enterprise/*`, `/admin/*`
- utility surfaces such as `/search`, `/notifications`, `/licenses`, `/markdown`, `/rate_limit`

The package has no built-in state model for these groups.

## Extension Surface

The package is better described as "a small GitHub-specific stateful layer on top of a generic OpenAPI mock server" than as a comprehensive GitHub REST simulator.

Consumers can extend it in three ways:

| Extension point          | Where                                    | What it enables                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extend.openapiHandlers` | `packages/github-api/src/index.ts`       | Add or replace OpenAPI operation handlers with access to the GitHub simulation store. |
| `extend.extendRouter`    | `packages/github-api/src/extend-api.ts`  | Add arbitrary Express routes or middleware outside the OpenAPI surface.               |
| `extend.extendStore`     | `packages/github-api/src/store/index.ts` | Add schema slices, actions, and selectors to support richer scripted behavior.        |

Current limitations of that extension model:

- `extend.openapiHandlers` is gated behind `initialState` because the handler map returns `{}` early otherwise.
- There is no built-in package API to replace the GraphQL handler directly.
- Base GitHub actions are empty, so mutating REST behavior must be added by consumers.

## Store and Modeling Constraints

The current store model is enough for a thin set of repository and installation flows, but it is not a close model of the GitHub REST domain.

Notable constraints:

- Installations are regenerated from organizations during `gitubInitialStoreSchema.parse(...)`, so caller-supplied installation rows are not independently authoritative.
- Repositories are keyed by `name`, not `owner/name`, so same-named repositories across different owners collide in the store.
- Branches are keyed only by `name`, so same-named branches across repositories collide.
- Generated repository, organization, and installation URLs assume `localhost:3300`.
- Authentication and authorization are intentionally not enforced.

These constraints reduce the realism of any attempt to script broader GitHub REST workflows.

## Non-OpenAPI Routes

The package also registers several routes outside the REST OpenAPI surface:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /graphql`
- `GET /login/oauth/authorize`
- `POST /login/oauth/access_token`
- `POST /api/v3/app/installations/:id/access_tokens`

These are useful simulator conveniences, but they should not be counted as GHES REST API completeness.

## Test Coverage Observed

The current test suite exercises only a subset of the explicit REST handlers:

- covered: installation lookup routes, installation repositories, org repos, branches, user org memberships
- not covered: installation access token, combined commit status, repository contents, git blob, git tree

That aligns with the current implementation shape: the most dynamic content handlers exist, but several partially stubbed or fragile handlers are not under direct test.

## Assessment

Relative to the GHES 3.20 REST documentation, `packages/github-api` is:

- strong as an example-backed OpenAPI stub server
- narrow as a built-in stateful GitHub REST mock
- reasonably extensible for teams willing to add their own handlers and store behavior
- not complete as a GHES 3.20 behavioral simulator

The best practical description is:

> Broad stub coverage is available through the loaded OpenAPI schema, but built-in scriptable GitHub behavior is limited to a small repository/installations/user slice.

## Recommended Follow-Ups

1. Decide whether the package should be audited against GHES 3.20 or against the bundled dotcom schema, then make the default explicit in docs.
2. Remove the `initialState` gate around `extend.openapiHandlers`, or document it as a hard requirement.
3. Fix `git/get-tree` to read `tree_sha` and add coverage for that route.
4. Add owner-aware keys for repositories and branches if deeper multi-repo scripting is a goal.
5. Add a support matrix to package docs that separates:
   - schema-stubbed operations
   - built-in stateful operations
   - extension-only operations
